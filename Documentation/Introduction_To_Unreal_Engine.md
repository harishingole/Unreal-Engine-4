The Viewport is our view into the world, it allows to see what is inside of our level manipulate those items.

Its the giant window in the middle of our screen where we can view our project

#### There are two main types of Viewports in Unreal Editor:

1.Perspective

The perspective view is a 3D window into the game world

2.Orthographic

The Orthographic views Front, Side, and Top are 2D Viewports that each look down one of the main axes

(X, Y, or Z).
