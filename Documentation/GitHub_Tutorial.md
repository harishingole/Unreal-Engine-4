**What is GitHub?**
**GitHub is a collaboration platform**. From software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and streamline every step of your project.



**How does it works ..?**

The video covered some of the most commonly-used features. Here are a few other items you can find in GitHub repositories:

* Project boards: Create Kanban-style task tracking board within GitHub
* Wiki: Create and store relevant project documentation
* Insights: View a drop-down menu that contains links to analytics tools for your repository including:
                        
Pulse: Find information about the work that has been completed and the work that’s in-progress in this project dashboard
Graphs: Graphs provide a more granular view of the repository activity including who contributed to the repository, who forked it, and when they completed the work

**Using GitHub issues**

Issues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:

* Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place
* Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests 
* Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions
* Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions
